            <h2>The Evolution of Board Games</h2>
            <p class="p">Board games have existed for thousands of years. Ancient civilizations played strategy games long before the modern era, and classics like chess have remained popular for centuries. These early games focused on competition, logic, and social interaction.
                Today, we are living in a new era of board gaming. Modern board games have expanded beyond traditional formats, introducing innovative mechanics, immersive themes, and cooperative gameplay. Instead of relying purely on luck, many modern games encourage meaningful decisions, teamwork, and strategic thinking. This evolution has created exciting experiences for players of all ages who are looking to discover something new at the table.</p>
