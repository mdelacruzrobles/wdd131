            <div class="about">
                <p>My name is Miguel De La Cruz, and I live in Connecticut, USA. I’m married and have three children, ages 14, 10, and 2. I’m originally from Peru, and my upbringing and cultural background have played an important role in shaping my values and perspective.
                    I work for a maintenance company, where I focus on being dependable, detail-oriented, and consistent in my work. I enjoy staying active and involved, whether it’s solving day-to-day challenges on the job or helping things run smoothly.
                    Outside of work, I like to spend my time being creative and active. I enjoy drawing in black and white, which allows me to express ideas in a simple and focused way. I also enjoy playing video games, playing soccer, and reading, which help me relax and unwind. These hobbies give me a good balance between creativity, activity, and downtime.
